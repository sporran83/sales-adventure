This won't take a moment. Easier to deal with it now and then it's done, right? And you don't want to be last in for the All-Hands meeting. <<print $boss_name>> has a habit of making fun of anyone who arrives late.

You hit Reply and start typing.

//"Hi <<print $client_PM_name>>,

Thanks for your email. I'll be happy to help you with this."//

You briefly consider what else to write. As usual, there isn't much to go on.

You open Zoom a few minutes before the appointed time. <<print $client_PM_name>> is already in the waiting room. It takes a few seconds to connect to audio and then <<print $client_PM_name>> appears. You notice he has his arms folded. You say hello and <<print $client_PM_name>> nods. "Hello."

You begin to doubt if you will hear back from the client, but the next day they reply. It's a long email with detailed questions - clearly they have carefully reviewed the information you sent!

Their questions are quite complex. What do you want to do?

:: Start Qualifying Meeting Slow
You decide to warm up the meeting before diving in by asking <<print $client_PM_name>> about the weather where he is and pointing out something interesting in the background of his video.

After a couple of minutes it's clear he is impatient to keep moving, so you decide to [[get down to business|Start Qualifying Meeting]].

:: Client Demands Demo
You start to ask <<print $client_PM_name>> your first question, but he quickly interrupts you.

"Listen", he says, "it's been <<print $sales_cycle>> days since I first wrote to you. I really just need to see a quick a demo of your product. I thought that was the purpose of this meeting. Can we skip to the demo please?"

You are a little taken aback, but you quickly compose yourself and realise exactly what you need to do next.

* [[Give the demo|Give Demo in Qualifying Meeting]]
* [[Push back|Refuse Demo in Qualifying Meeting]]

:: Even More Demo
<<print $client_PM_name>> asks you a follow-up question, so you spend a few minutes showing him another section of the product.
<<if visited("Follow up Materials") >0>>You realise it's the same section he was asking about in his email.<<endif>>

At this point you're now almost out of time, and <<print $client_PM_name>> says he has [[another meeting to go to|End Qualifying Meeting]].

"I realise we've only scratched the surface here today", you tell <<print $client_PM_name>>. "We can always schedule another session to go more in-depth if you'd like?"

"It's as I told you". He looks at you.
<<else>>In the remaining minutes of the meeting, you ask <<print $client_PM_name>> about next steps.<<endif>>

"Once we've finished our initial investigations, we'll get in touch with the suppliers we're interested in", he says.

You thank <<print $client_PM_name>> for his time and the meeting ends.

Well, that was interesting. Time to <<linkappend "take a look at your notes." t8n>>

So far, here's what you know:
/% if the inventory contains nothing, show "nothing" %/\

Ultimately of course, you set out wanting to <<print $QualifyingMeetingPurpose>>. You wonder how well you did.

With the meeting now finished, you stretch your legs and take a break.

Afterwards, things get busy and you get swept up in other work. A couple of weeks later, <<print $client_PM_name>> [[writes to you again|Invite to 2nd meeting][$sales_cycle to $sales_cycle + 14]].

<<run $inventory.push('Research Committee needs a new central solution for managing their publications.')>>\

You ask <<print $client_PM_name>> to talk you through the project.

He explains the decision has been made by research committee that they need some way of managing their publications better - a new central solution. <<print $client_PM_name>> has been asked to start looking at <<linkappend "possible suppliers." t8n>><<run $inventory.push('They are looking at a broad range of suppliers, including your competitors.')>>

You probe him for more specifics on this. He tells you that they are looking at a broad range of suppliers at this stage and mentions a couple of your competitors.

* [[Return to your original questions|Ask Qualifying Questions]]

:: Refuse Demo in Qualifying Meeting
Taking a firm but respectful tone, you tell <<print $client_PM_name>> that while you can appreciate he is keen to see a demo, Pure is a large and complex system and it would be a waste of his time and yours to demo aimlessly without first understanding more about the specifics of his situation.

<<print $client_PM_name>> explains that at the moment they have enormous difficulty reporting their publications to funders. They have some concerns about how well prepared they are for future major grants rounds.

Things get busy and you get swept up in other work. You almost forget about <<print $client_PM_name>>'s email altogether. Finally, more than a month later, you [[get a response|Invite to 2nd meeting][$sales_cycle to $sales_cycle + 35]].

:: Invite to 2nd meeting
You read <<print $client_PM_name>>'s latest email.

<blockquote>Hi,

Following our initial investigations, we have determined that 8 suppliers will have the opportunity to give an early 1-hour presentation regarding our new publications management project.

We invite you to come show us your system in two weeks' time. 

Regards,
<<print $client_PM_name>>
Project Manager

How interesting! You begin thinking about how best to prepare.

You decide you need time to craft a thoughtful reply, so you spend a while <<linkappend "browsing the client's website." t8n>>

It seems <<print $client_PM_name>>'s university has a strong research interest in bioinformatics and recently had some major grants renewed. <<run $inventory.push('They have a strong research interest in bioinformatics and recently had some major grants renewed.')>>

Having seen enough for now, you begin to craft an email reply.

//"Hi <<print $client_PM_name>>,

Thanks for your email. I'll be happy to help you with this.

I see you had some major grants renewed - congratulations! You'll be pleased to know our product has some powerful features to support outcomes reporting to funders. We also have experience working with other similar institutions in your region such as..."// (you list some of their peers)

<<if visited("Long Reply") is 1>>As you reach the meeting room, you hear the sound of your boss <<print $boss_name>>'s voice talking about the company financials. Damn! The All-Hands meeting has already started.

As usual, it's a long meeting that could've been an email, you think to yourself.

:: Intro 2
It's a busy morning at the office and you're already onto your second coffee. Your colleague <<print $colleague_name>> walks past your desk.

"Hi <<print $player_name>>, are you coming to the meeting?", says <<print $colleague_name>>. "<<print $boss_name>> looks like he is in one of his moods today."

You sigh and deflate a little. The All-Hands meeting! Is it really time for another of those again already? Still, they must know what they're doing, you think.

"Sure, be there in a sec", you tell <<print $colleague_name>>, "save me a seat."

You take a final sip of coffee and check the time. You still have a few minutes before the All-Hands meeting starts, so you quickly [[check the shared sales inbox|Inbound Lead]].

:: Prepare 1st Meeting
While you have several aims and all of them are important, you realise that ultimately the main thing you are keen to accomplish in your first meeting with <<print $client_PM_name>> is to <<print $QualifyingMeetingPurpose>>.

You think about what you want to do in the meeting. 30 minutes means you will have time for no more than five things.

:: Ask More Time
30 minutes isn't long enough for this meeting, you think. You email <<print $client_PM_name>> to ask for an hour instead so you have time to cover everything.

But he quickly replies and says he is just gathering information at this stage and only has a few questions and time for a quick demo, so 30 minutes should be sufficient.

Ah well. Seems 30 minutes is all you're going to get. You go back to considering [[what you want to do in the meeting|Prepare 1st Meeting]].

:: Confirm Qualifying Meeting
You reply to <<print $client_PM_name>> to thank him for agreeing to meet. You confirm the date and time and let him know you are looking forward to speaking soon. You consider whether or not to include a specific agenda.

* [[Include an agenda|Precondition Qualifying Meeting][$PreconditionQualifyingMeeting to true]]
* [[Don't include an agenda|Don't Precondition Qualifying Meeting][$PreconditionQualifyingMeeting to false]]

:: Precondition Qualifying Meeting
Respectful of everyone's time, you decide to include a clear agenda - it's never too soon to start setting and delivering on expectations. You write:

//Hi <<print $client_PM_name>>,

Thanks for agreeing to meet. I can confirm the date and time you've suggested works well and will send you an invite and Zoom details shortly.

So that I can better help you, I will have some questions for you on our call. I will have these prepared and it will take around 15 minutes. I will also be able to answer your questions. If there is something specific you would like to cover on our call, please let me know so that I can prepare.

Looking forward to meeting you.

Speak soon,
<<print $player_name>>//

You <<linkappend "send the email." t8n>> A little while later, <<print $client_PM_name>> gets in touch to let you know he got the invite and to say it would be good to see a demo of the product on the call.

That's useful to know.

Soon, [[the day of the meeting approaches|1st Meeting]].<</linkappend>>

:: Don't Precondition Qualifying Meeting
Not wanting to appear pushy or overly formal at this early stage, you simply sign off with a quick thankyou. It's only the first meeting â€“ better to let things happen organically, you think.

Soon, [[the day of the meeting approaches|1st Meeting]].

:: Q-Intro Company
You spend several minutes taking <<print $client_PM_name>> through a series of slides about your company's background and mission, including recent efforts to improve scholarly publishing capability in developing nations.

After you've finished, you ask <<print $client_PM_name>> if he has any questions. He doesn't.

[[Move on to another topic|Ask Qualifying Questions]]


:: Q-Intro Team
You spend a moment or two talking to a slide showing your company's organisational chart, before showing <<print $client_PM_name>> a fun slide that has all your team members on it, their backgrounds and their favourite animals. You always have fun showing people this slide.

You consider asking <<print $client_PM_name>> if he has a favourite animal, but then decide against it.

[[Move on to another topic|Ask Qualifying Questions]]

:: Q-Intro Product
You bring up the standard info deck for your product and spend several minutes explaining each of the key features. It always takes a little while, but there's so much important information to cover.

You notice <<print $client_PM_name>> taking notes.

[[Move on to another topic|Ask Qualifying Questions]]

:: Qualify Rapport
You decide this is an ideal moment to try to get to know <<print $client_PM_name>> a little better.
