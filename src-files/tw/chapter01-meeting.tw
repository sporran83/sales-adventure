It's nearly time for your meeting with <<print $client_PM_name>>, <<print $sales_cycle>> days after first receiving their email.

You open Zoom a few minutes before the appointed time. <<print $client_PM_name>> is already in the waiting room. It takes a few seconds to connect to audio and then <<print $client_PM_name>> appears. You notice he has his arms folded. You say hello and <<print $client_PM_name>> nods.

<<sean>>Hello.<</sean>>

What do you do next?

[[Dive right into it|Start Qualifying Meeting]]
[[Make pleasant chit-chat for a few moments|Start Qualifying Meeting Slow]]

:: Start Qualifying Meeting Slow
You decide to warm up the meeting before diving in by asking <<print $client_PM_name>> about the weather where he is and pointing out something interesting in the background of his video.

After a couple of minutes it's clear he is impatient to keep moving, so you decide to [[get down to business|Start Qualifying Meeting]].

:: Client Demands Demo
You start to ask <<print $client_PM_name>> your first question, but he quickly interrupts you.

<<sean>>Listen, it's been <<print $sales_cycle>> days since I first wrote to you. I really just need to see a quick a demo of your product. I thought that was the purpose of this meeting. Can we skip to the demo please?<</sean>>

You are a little taken aback, but you quickly compose yourself and realise exactly what you need to do next.

* [[Give the demo|Give Demo in Qualifying Meeting]]
* [[Push back|Refuse Demo in Qualifying Meeting]]

:: Even More Demo
<<print $client_PM_name>> asks you a follow-up question, so you spend a few minutes showing him another section of the product.
<<if visited("Follow up Materials") >0>>You realise it's the same section he was asking about in his email.<<endif>>

At this point you're now almost out of time, and <<print $client_PM_name>> says he has [[another meeting to go to|End Qualifying Meeting]].

:: Offer Second Demo
"I realise we've only scratched the surface here today", you tell <<print $client_PM_name>>. "We can always schedule another session to go more in-depth if you'd like?"

<<print $client_PM_name>> says thanks but tells you he has everything he needs for now.

:: End Qualifying Meeting
<<if visited("Qualify Budget") is 1>>Before <<print $client_PM_name>> leaves, you quickly ask about next steps.

<<sean>>It's as I told you<</sean>>
He looks at you.
<<else>>In the remaining minutes of the meeting, you ask <<print $client_PM_name>> about next steps.<<endif>>

<<sean>>Once we've finished our initial investigations, we'll get in touch with the suppliers we're interested in.<</sean>>

You thank <<print $client_PM_name>> for his time and the meeting ends.

Well, that was interesting. Time to <<linkappend "take a look at your notes." t8n>>

So far, here's what you know:
/% if the inventory contains nothing, show "nothing" %/\
<<if $inventory.length is 0>>\
    Nothing.
<<else>>\
    /% the Array#join() method combines all array elements into a single string, with each element separated by the argument given %/\
    * <<= $inventory.join('<br>* ')>>.
<</if>>

Intriguing. You take a moment to <<linkappend "reflect on your meeting." t8n>>

Ultimately of course, you set out wanting to <<print $QualifyingMeetingPurpose>>. You wonder how well you did.

<<if $PointsQualifyDemo is false>>You didn't end up giving <<print $client_PM_name>> a demo in this meeting, even though he said he wanted one. You wonder whether that matters, all things considered<<endif>>\
<<if $PointsQualifyDemo is false>>You still don't know what drove him to reach out to you in the first place. <<endif>>\
<<if $PointsQualifyTimeline is false >>A pity you didn't find out anything about <<print $client_PM_name>>'s timeline. <<endif>>\
<<if $PointsQualifyWho is false>>It would've been good to ask who is involved in the project besides <<print $client_PM_name>>. <<endif>>\
<<if $QualifyAnswerQuestions is true>>What about all those detailed questions <<print $client_PM_name>> emailed you about? Oh well.<<endif>>\

With the meeting now finished, you stretch your legs and take a break.

Afterwards, things get busy and you get swept up in other work. A couple of weeks later, <<print $client_PM_name>> [[writes to you again|Invite to 2nd meeting][$sales_cycle to $sales_cycle + 14]].

:: Qualify Why
<<run $inventory.push('Research Committee needs a new central solution for managing their publications.')>>\
<<set $PointsQualifyWhy to true>>\

You ask <<print $client_PM_name>> to talk you through the project.

<<sean>>The decision has been made by research committee that we need some way of managing their publications better - a new central solution. I've been asked to start looking at <<linkappend "possible suppliers." t8n>><<run $inventory.push('They are looking at a broad range of suppliers, including your competitors.')>>

We are looking at a broad range of suppliers at this stage, including Symplectic and Converis. As you can imagine, we are considering a <<linkappend "broad range of options." t8n>><<run $inventory.push('They are considering whether to build their own system.')>> For example, we are also talking to the computer science people to see if it's possible to build something in-house.<</linkappend>><</linkappend>><</sean>>

Realising you are quickly chewing through your meeting time, you:

* [[Ask if he would like to see something specific|Even More Demo]]
* [[Offer a more in-depth demo at another time|Offer Second Demo]]
* [[Return to your original questions|Ask Qualifying Questions]]

:: Refuse Demo in Qualifying Meeting
Taking a firm but respectful tone, you tell <<print $client_PM_name>> that while you can appreciate he is keen to see a demo, Pure is a large and complex system and it would be a waste of his time and yours to demo aimlessly without first understanding more about the specifics of his situation.

You brace yourself for a tense moment, but <<print $client_PM_name>> agrees. Unfolding his arms, he [[offers to tell you about the project|Qualify Why][$QualifyWhy to false]].

:: Qualify Budget
<<run $inventory.push('<<print $client_PM_name>> did not like being asked about the budget in your first meeting.')>>\

You ask <<print $client_PM_name>> if there is budget put aside for the work at this stage.

He frowns.

<<sean>>Look mate, I'm just gathering information at this stage. If you had more information on your website I wouldn't need to be having this meeting.

It's much too early to be asking about money. If we're interested, we'll talk about it when we're ready.<</sean>>

Oh dear. It looks like you've <<linkappend "offended Sean." t8n>>

<<sean>>I have another meeting to get to, but I've got everything I need for now. We'll be in touch.<</sean>>

It seems you have no alternative but to [[wrap things up|End Qualifying Meeting]].<</linkappend>><</linkappend>>

:: Qualify Why 2
<<run $inventory.push('They have enormous difficulty reporting their publications to funders and are concerned about how well prepared they are for future major grants rounds.')>>

You decide to probe further and ask if there are specific issues about the way they manage publications at the moment.

<<print $client_PM_name>> explains that at the moment they have enormous difficulty reporting their publications to funders. They have some concerns about how well prepared they are for future major grants rounds.

You make a note of this, wondering if there are any <<linkappend "more use cases to discover." t8n>><<run $inventory.push('They are thinking of starting a new biolab. Since they are seeking government funding for this, they will also need analysis on what work they have done in this area.')>> When you ask, it turns out they are also thinking of starting a new biolab.

You ask <<print $client_PM_name>> if he has a 'go-live' date in mind.

<<run $inventory.push('There is a more rigorous procurement process in place for new projects.')>>\
